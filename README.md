# llm-chat-sidebar-ui

A UI for an LLM chat with a sidebar with a tree structure showing previous chats as well as indexed messages within that chat in a collapsible tree. A chat can be 'active' / open - when that is the case there is a message box as well as a grid of 'frames' snapshots from the chat  that can be brought up for examination, as well as a adjustable sized results window where responses from the LLM are sent to.
